# Building and installing AdaptiveCpp


## Operating system support

Operating system support currently strongly focuses on Linux. On Mac, only the CPU backend is expected to work. Windows support with CPU and CUDA backends is experimental, see [Using AdaptiveCpp on Windows](https://github.com/OpenSYCL/OpenSYCL/wiki/Using-Open-SYCL-on-Windows).

## Installation from source (Linux)

### Software dependencies
In order to successfully build and install AdaptiveCpp, the following dependencies must be installed for all backends:

* python 3 (for the `acpp` compiler driver)
* `cmake`
* the Boost C++ libraries (in particular `boost.fiber`, `boost.context` and for the unit tests `boost.test`)
  * it may be helpful to set the `BOOST_ROOT` `cmake` variable to the path to the root directory of Boost you wish to use if `cmake` does not find it automatically
  * **Note for boost 1.78 users:** There seems to be a bug in the build system for boost 1.78, causing the compiled fiber and context libraries not to be copied to the installation directory. You will have to copy these libraries manually to the installation directory. In binary packages from some distribution repositories this issue is fixed. You might be only affected when building boost manually from source.

In addition, the various supported [compilation flows](compilation.md) and programming models have additional requirements:

### A standard installation

For a standard installation that has the most important features enabled, you will additionally need to install an official LLVM release >= 14. Please do not use a development version or vendor-specific fork of LLVM.
This can be very conveniently be achieved e.g. using https://apt.llvm.org [(detailed instructions)](install-llvm.md).

Next, ensure that you have the stacks installed that you want to target (e.g. CUDA, ROCm, OpenCL etc).

AdaptiveCpp will automatically enable all backends that it finds on the system, so in typical scenarios, the following is sufficient:

```
git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp
cd AdaptiveCpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/desired/install/location ..
make install
```
If it does not find some backends or does not pick up the right LLVM, please look at the documentation for the individual components linked below.


### Advanced installation

Advanced users may want to customize their installation more, or use features that are not so commonly used. The following sections describe requirements for individual components in more detail.

#### Compilation flows

| Compilation flow | Target hardware | Short description | Requirements |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `omp.library-only` | Any CPU | OpenMP CPU backend | Any OpenMP compiler |
| `omp.accelerated` | Any CPU supported by LLVM | OpenMP CPU backend (compiler-accelerated)| LLVM >= 14 |
| `cuda.integrated-multipass` | NVIDIA GPUs | CUDA backend (clang)| CUDA >= 10, LLVM >= 14 |
| `cuda.explicit-multipass` | NVIDIA GPUs | CUDA backend (clang, can be targeted simultaneously with other backends) | CUDA >= 10, LLVM >= 14 |
| `cuda-nvcxx` | NVIDIA GPUs | CUDA backend (nvc++) | Latest NVIDIA HPC SDK |
| `hip.integrated-multipass` | AMD GPUs (supported by ROCm) | HIP backend (clang) | ROCm >= 4.0, LLVM >= 14 |
| `generic` | NVIDIA, AMD, Intel GPUs, OpenCL SPIR-V devices | Generic single-pass compiler | LLVM >= 14. When dispatching kernels to AMD hardware, ROCm >= 5.3 is recommended and LLVM must be <= the ROCm LLVM version. When dispatching to NVIDIA, clang needs nvptx64 backend enabled. AdaptiveCpp runtime backends for the respective target hardware need to be available. |

Note: Building against `libc++` instead of `libstdc++` is only expected to work for the `generic` target. Additionally, AdaptiveCpp must have been built using the same standard library that the user code is linked against.
`libc++` is currently not supported for the C++ standard parallelism offloading model.

#### Models

* SYCL: (No SYCL-specific requirements)
* C++ standard parallelism: See [here](stdpar.md) for dependencies.

Please make sure to read the instructions below for the dependencies that apply to your use case.

#### LLVM (skip if you only want flows without LLVM dependency)

Follow [these](install-llvm.md) instructions.

#### CUDA (skip if you don't need CUDA support)

Follow [these](install-cuda.md) instructions

#### ROCm (skip if you don't need ROCm support)

Follow [these](install-rocm.md) instructions

#### SPIR-V/Level Zero (skip if you don't need SPIR-V/Level Zero support)

Follow [these](install-spirv.md) instructions.

#### SPIR-V/OpenCL (skip if you don't need SPIR-V/OpenCL support)

Follow [these](install-ocl.md) instructions.

#### Building and installing 

Once the software requirements mentioned above are met, clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp
```
Then, create a build directory and compile AdaptiveCpp. As described below, some backends and compilation flows must be configured with specific cmake arguments which should be passed during the cmake step.

```
$ cd <build directory>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation prefix> <more optional options, e.g. to configure the LLVM dependency> <AdaptiveCpp source directory>
$ make install
```

The default installation prefix is `/usr/local`. Change this to your liking.
**Note: AdaptiveCpp needs to be installed to function correctly; don't replace "make install" with just "make"!**

##### CMake options to configure the AdaptiveCpp build

###### General
*  `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` should be pointed to the C++ compiler to compile AdaptiveCpp with. Note that this also sets the default C++ compiler for the CPU backend when using acpp once AdaptiveCpp is installed. This can however also be modified later using `HIPSYCL_CPU_CXX`.

###### generic

* `-DWITH_SSCP_COMPILER=OFF/ON` can be used to explicitly enable or disable the generic SSCP compiler.

###### omp.library-only

* `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` can be used to set the default OpenMP compiler.

###### omp.accelerated

* `-DWITH_ACCELERATED_CPU=OFF/ON` can be used to explicitly disable/enable CPU acceleration. Support for CPU acceleration is enabled by default when enabling the LLVM dependency, and LLVM is sufficiently new.

###### cuda.*

* See the CUDA [installation instructions](install-cuda.md) instructions (section on clang).

###### cuda-nvcxx

* See the CUDA [installation instructions](install-cuda.md) instructions (section on nvc++).

###### hip.*

* See the ROCm [installation instructions](install-rocm.md) instructions.


## Installation from source (Mac)

On Mac, only the CPU backends are supported. The required steps are analogous to Linux.

## Installation from source (Windows)

For experimental building on Windows (CPU and CUDA backends) see the corresponding [wiki](https://github.com/OpenSYCL/OpenSYCL/wiki/Using-AdaptiveCpp-on-Windows).
The `omp.accelerated` CPU compilation flow is unsupported on Windows.
