# Important branches in hipSYCL

Please take note of the branch structure of the project. The following are important branches:

* `stable` - contains latest hipSYCL with additional testing. `stable` should always contain a version of hipSYCL that we are confident is stable.
* `develop` - contains latest development version.
* `sycl/VERSION` - contains hipSYCL code that targets a specific SYCL version.
   - `sycl/1.2.1` - contains latest hipSYCL targeting SYCL 1.2.1. This branch is now mainly in maintenance mode. If you want to specifically improve hipSYCL SYCL 1.2.1 support, please use this branch.
   - `sycl/2020` - contains latest hipSYCL work targeting SYCL 2020, and any work that is not specific to earlier SYCL versions.

We periodically perform the following merges:
* `develop` -> `sycl/<latest-version>` -> `stable`


Please follow the following guidelines:
* **File your PR against the `develop` branch, unless you are specifically targeting an earlier SYCL version.**
* **If you are targeting an earlier SYCL version, target the appropriate `sycl/<version>` branch**
