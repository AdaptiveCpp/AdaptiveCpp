# Using AdaptiveCpp in projects
It is recommended to use the CMake integration for larger projects. See the section on the cmake integration below. Alternatively, `acpp` can be used directly as a compiler.

## Using acpp

`acpp` can be invoked like a regular compiler (e.g. `acpp -O3 -o test test.cpp`). It supports multiple compilation flows. In a typical installation (i.e. when AdaptiveCpp was built against LLVM >= 14 and the generic SSCP compiler was not explicitly disabled), it uses the `generic` compilation flow by default. This compilation flow usually compiles the fastest, produces the fastest binaries, and its generated binaries can run on all supported devices. **Unless you have have very specific needs, you probably should use the default `generic` compiler.**

Advanced users or users with more specific needs may want to specify compilation flows explicitly.This is achieved with the `--acpp-targets="compilation-flow1:target1,target2,...;compilation-flow2:..."` command line argument, `ACPP_TARGETS` environment variable or cmake argument.

**Other compilation flows like omp, cuda, hip are typically mostly interesting for backend interoperability use cases, not if performance is the top priority.**.

## AdaptiveCpp targets specification

Both `acpp` and the cmake integration can be optionally provided with an AdaptiveCpp targets specification. This specification defines which compilation flows AdaptiveCpp should enable, and which devices from a compilation flow AdaptiveCpp should target during compilation. In general, it has the form:

```
"flow1:target1,target2,...;flow2:...;..."
```
and can be passed either as `acpp` command line argument (`--acpp-targets=...`), environment variable (`ACPP_TARGETS=...`) or CMake argument (`-DACPP_TARGETS=...`) depending on whether `acpp` or `cmake` is used.

"compilation flow" refers to one of the available compilation flows defined in the [compilation flow](compilation.md) documentation.


### Requirements for specifying targets of individual compilation flows

Whether a compilation flow needs to be followed by a target list or not varies between the available flows and is described below.

For the following compilation flows, targets cannot be specified:
* `omp.*`
* `generic`

For the following compilation flows, targets can optionally be specified:
* `cuda-nvcxx` - Targets take the format of `ccXY` where `XY` stands for the compute capability of the device.

For the following compilation flows, targets must be specified:
* `cuda.*` - The target format is defined by clang and takes the format of `sm_XY`. For example:
  * `sm_52`: NVIDIA Maxwell GPUs
  * `sm_60`: NVIDIA Pascal GPUs
  * `sm_70`: NVIDIA Volta GPUs
* `hip.*` - The target format is defined by clang and takes the format of `gfxXYZ`. For example:
  * `gfx900`: AMD Vega 10 GPUs (e.g. Radeon Vega 56, Vega 64)
  * `gfx906`: AMD Vega 20 GPUs (e.g. Radeon VII, Instinct MI50)
  * `gfx908`: AMD CDNA GPUs (e.g Instinct MI100)

### Abbreviations

For some compilation flows, abbreviations exist that will be resolved by AdaptiveCpp to one of the available compilation flows:
* `omp` will be translated 
  * into `omp.accelerated` 
     * if AdaptiveCpp has been built with support for accelerated CPU and the host compiler is the clang that AdaptiveCpp has been built with or
     * if `--acpp-use-accelerated-cpu` is set. If the accelerated CPU compilation flow is not available (e.g. AdaptiveCpp has been compiled without support for it), compilation will abort with an error.
  * into `omp.library-only` otherwise
* `cuda` will be translated
  * into `cuda.explicit-multipass`
    * if another integrated multipass has been requested, or another backend that would conflict with `cuda.integrated-multipass`. AdaptiveCpp will emit a warning in this case, since switching to explicit multipass can change interoperability guarantees (see the [compilation](compilation.md) documentation).
    * if `--acpp-explicit-multipass` is set explicitly
  * into `cuda.integrated-multipass` otherwise
* `hip` will be translated into `hip.integrated-multipass`

Of course, the desired flows can also always be specified explicitly.

### Examples

* `generic` - creates a binary that can run on all backends. This also typically creates the fastest binaries.
* `"omp.library-only;cuda.explicit-multipass:sm_61;sm_70"`  - compiles for the CPU backend and Pascal and Volta era GPUs
* `"omp;cuda:sm_70;hip:gfx906"`  - compiles for the CPU backend (library or accelerated), NVIDIA Volta era GPUs via explicit multipass, AMD Vega 20 GPUs
* `"omp.accelerated;cuda:sm_70;spirv`" - compiles for the CPU backend (compiler accelerated), NVIDIA Volta era GPUs, and SPIR-V devices
* `"omp;cuda-nvcxx"` - compiles for the CPU backend and NVIDIA GPUs using nvc++

### Offloading C++ standard parallelism

               Backend Flavors:
               - omp.library-only: Works with any OpenMP enabled CPU compiler.
                                   Uses Boost.Fiber for nd_range parallel_for support.
               - omp.accelerated: Uses clang as host compiler to enable compiler support

      * hip  - HIP backend
               Requires specification of targets of the form gfxXYZ,
               e.g. gfx906 for Vega 20, gfx900 for Vega 10

--acpp-stdpar-prefetch-mode=<value>
  [can also be set with environment variable: ACPP_STDPAR_PREFETCH_MODE=<value>]
  [default value provided by field 'default-stdpar-prefetch-mode' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  AdaptiveCpp supports issuing automati USM prefetch operations for allocations used inside offloaded C++ PSTL
    algorithms. This flags determines the strategy for submitting such prefetches.
    Supported values are:
      * always      - Prefetches every allocation used by every stdpar kernel
      * never       - Disables prefetching
      * after-sync  - Prefetch all allocations used by the first kernel submitted after each synchronization point.
                      (Prefetches running on non-idling queues can be expensive!)
      * first       - Prefetch allocations only the very first time they are used in a kernel
      * auto        - Let AdaptiveCpp decide (default)

--acpp-use-accelerated-cpu
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_USE_ACCELERATED_CPU to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-use-accelerated-cpu' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, Clang is used for host compilation and explicit compiler support
  is enabled for accelerating the nd-range parallel_for on CPU.
  Uses continuation-based synchronization to execute all work-items
  of a work-group in a single thread, eliminating scheduling overhead
  and enabling enhanced vectorization opportunities compared to the fiber variant.

--acpp-dryrun
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_DRYRUN to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-is-dryrun' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, only shows compilation commands that would be executed, 
  but does not actually execute it. 

--acpp-explicit-multipass
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_EXPLICIT_MULTIPASS to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-is-explicit-multipass' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, executes device passes as separate compiler invocation and lets AdaptiveCpp control embedding device
  images into the host binary. This allows targeting multiple backends simultaneously that might otherwise be
  incompatible. In this mode, source code level interoperability may not be supported in the host pass.
  For example, you cannot use the CUDA kernel launch syntax[i.e. kernel <<< ... >>> (...)] in this mode. 

--acpp-save-temps
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_SAVE_TEMPS to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-save-temps' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, do not delete temporary files created during compilation.

--acpp-stdpar
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_STDPAR to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-is-stdpar' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, enables SYCL offloading of C++ standard parallel algorithms.

--acpp-stdpar-system-usm
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_STDPAR_SYSTEM_USM to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-is-stdpar-system-usm' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  If set, assume availability of system-level unified shared memory where every pointer from regular
  malloc() is accessible on GPU. This disables automatic hijacking of memory allocations at the compiler
  level by AdaptiveCpp.

--acpp-stdpar-unconditional-offload
  [can also be set by setting environment variable ACPP_STDPAR_UNCONDITIONAL_OFFLOAD to any value other than false|off|0 ]
  [default value provided by field 'default-is-stdpar-unconditional-offload' in JSON files from directories: ['/install/path/etc/AdaptiveCpp'].]
  [current value: NOT SET]
  Normally, heuristics are employed to determine whether algorithms should be offloaded.
  This particularly affects small problem sizes. If this flag is set, supported parallel STL
  algorithms will be offloaded unconditionally.

--acpp-version
  Print AdaptiveCpp version and configuration

--help

Any other options will be forwarded to the compiler.

Note: Command line arguments take precedence over environment variables.

## Using the CMake integration
Setting up a project using the AdaptiveCpp CMake integration is quite straight forward.
The main points are adding `find_package(AdaptiveCpp REQUIRED)` and after defining the targets to build, adding `add_sycl_to_target(TARGET <target_name>)` to have the compilation handled by the AdaptiveCpp toolchain.
See the [example cmake project](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp/blob/develop/examples/CMakeLists.txt).

A typical configure command line looks like this: `cmake .. -DAdaptiveCpp_DIR=/acpp/install/dir/lib/cmake/AdaptiveCpp -DACPP_TARGETS="<targets>"`.
`ACPP_TARGETS` has to be set either as environment variable or on the command line for the `find_package` call to succeed. See the documentation of this flag above.

If the accelerated CPU flow has been built, `-DACPP_USE_ACCELERATED_CPU=ON/OFF` can be used to override whether `omp` should refer to the `omp.library-only` or `omp.accelerated` compilation flow.
