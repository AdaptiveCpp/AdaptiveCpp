# AdaptiveCpp (formerly known as hipSYCL / Open SYCL)

**(Note: This project is currently in progress of changing its name to AdaptiveCpp due to external legal pressure. Documentation and code may still use the older name hipSYCL / Open SYCL)**

AdaptiveCpp is the independent, community-driven modern platform for C++-based heterogeneous programming models targeting CPUs and GPUs from all major vendors. AdaptiveCpp lets applications adapt themselves to all the hardware found in the system. This includes use cases where a single binary needs to be able to target all supported hardware, or utilize hardware from different vendors simultaneously.

It currently supports the following programming models:
1. **SYCL**: At its core is a SYCL implementation that supports many use cases and approaches of implementing SYCL. 
2. **C++ standard parallelism**: Additionally, AdaptiveCpp features experimental support for offloading C++ algorithms from the parallel STL. See [here](doc/stdpar.md) for details on which algorithms can be offloaded. **AdaptiveCpp is currently the only solution that can offload C++ standard parallelism constructs to GPUs from Intel, NVIDIA and AMD -- even from a single binary.**

Supported compilation flows include ([details](doc/compilation.md)):

1. **A generic, single-pass compiler infrastructure that compiles kernels to a unified code representation** that is then lowered at runtime to target devices, providing a high degree of portability, low compilation times, flexibility and extensibility. **AdaptiveCpp is the only major SYCL implementation that supports a single-pass compiler design, where the code is only parsed once for both host and target devices**. Support includes:
   1. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs through PTX;
   2. AMD ROCm GPUs through amdgcn code;
   3. Intel GPUs through SPIR-V (Level Zero);
   4. SPIR-V compatible OpenCL devices supporting Intel USM extensions or fine-grained system SVM (such as Intel's OpenCL implementation for CPUs or GPUs)
2. Additionally, **AdaptiveCpp can aggregate existing clang toolchains and augment them with support for SYCL constructs**. This allows for a high degree of interoperability between SYCL and other models such as CUDA or HIP. For example, in this mode, the AdaptiveCpp CUDA and ROCm backends rely on the clang CUDA/HIP frontends that have been augmented by AdaptiveCpp to *additionally* also understand other models like SYCL. This means that the AdaptiveCpp compiler can not only compile SYCL code, but also CUDA/HIP code *even if they are mixed in the same source file*, making all CUDA/HIP features - such as the latest device intrinsics - also available from SYCL code ([details](doc/hip-source-interop.md)). Additionally, vendor-optimized template libraries such as rocPRIM or CUB can also be used with AdaptiveCpp. This allows for highly optimized code paths in SYCL code for specific devices. Support includes:
   1. Any LLVM-supported CPU (including e.g. x86, arm, power etc) through the regular clang host toolchain with dedicated compiler transformation to accelerate SYCL constructs;
   2. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs through the clang CUDA toolchain;
   3. AMD ROCm GPUs through the clang HIP toolchain;
   4. Intel GPUs through oneAPI Level Zero and the clang SYCL toolchain (*highly* experimental, deprecated)
3. Or **AdaptiveCpp can be used in library-only compilation flows**. In these compilation flows, AdaptiveCpp acts as a C++ library for third-party compilers. This can have portability advantages or simplify deployment. This includes support:
   1. Any CPU supported by any OpenMP compilers;
   2. NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA and the NVIDIA nvc++ compiler, bringing NVIDIA vendor support and day 1 hardware support to the SYCL ecosystem

The following illustration shows the complete stack and its capabilities to target hardware:

Because a program compiled with AdaptiveCpp appears just like any other program written in vendor-supported programming models (like CUDA or HIP) to vendor-provided software, vendor tools such as profilers or debuggers also work well with AdaptiveCpp.

An illustration on how the project fits into the SYCL ecosystem can be found ([here](doc/sycl-ecosystem.md)).

## About the project

While AdaptiveCpp started its life as a hobby project, development is now primarily led and funded by Heidelberg University, with contributions from the community. AdaptiveCpp not only serves as a research platform, but is also a solution used in production on machines of all scales, including some of the most powerful supercomputers.

### Extracting performance & benchmarking AdaptiveCpp

#### General performance hints

* Building AdaptiveCpp against newer LLVM generally results in better performance for backends that are relying on LLVM.
* Unlike other SYCL implementations that may rely on kernel compilation at runtime, some compilation flows in AdaptiveCpp rely heavily on ahead-of-time compilation. So make sure to use appropriate optimization flags when compiling.
* For the CPU backend:
   * Don't forget that, due to AdaptiveCpp's ahead-of-time compilation nature, you may also want to enable latest vectorization instruction sets when compiling, e.g. using `-march=native`.
   * Enable OpenMP thread pinning (e.g. `OMP_PROC_BIND=true`). AdaptiveCpp uses asynchronous worker threads for some light-weight tasks such as garbage collection, and these additional threads can interfere with kernel execution if OpenMP threads are not bound to cores.
   * Don't use `nd_range` parallel for unless you absolutely have to, as it is difficult to map efficiently to CPUs. 
      * If you don't need barriers or local memory, use `parallel_for` with `range` argument.
      * If you need local memory or barriers, scoped parallelism or hierarchical parallelism models may perform better on CPU than `parallel_for` kernels using `nd_range` argument and should be preferred. Especially scoped parallelism also works well on GPUs.
      * If you *have* to use `nd_range parallel_for` with barriers on CPU, the `omp.accelerated` compilation flow will most likely provide substantially better performance than the `omp.library-only` compilation target. See the [documentation on compilation flows](doc/compilation.md) for details.
* For performance in the C++ parallelism model specifically, see also [here](doc/stdpar.md).

#### Comparing against other LLVM-based compilers

When targeting the CUDA or HIP backends, AdaptiveCpp just massages the AST slightly to get `clang -x cuda` and `clang -x hip` to accept SYCL code. AdaptiveCpp is not involved in the actual code generation. Therefore *any significant deviation in kernel performance compared to clang-compiled CUDA or clang-compiled HIP is unexpected.*

As a consequence, if you compare it to other llvm-based compilers please make sure to compile AdaptiveCpp against the same llvm version. Otherwise you would effectively be simply comparing the performance of two different LLVM versions. This is in particular true when comparing it to clang CUDA or clang HIP.


## Current state
AdaptiveCpp is not yet a fully conformant SYCL implementation, although many SYCL programs already work with AdaptiveCpp.
* SYCL 2020 [feature support matrix](https://github.com/hipSYCL/featuresupport)
* A (likely incomplete) list of [limitations](doc/limitations.md) for older SYCL 1.2.1 features
* A (also incomplete) timeline showing development [history](doc/history.md)

## Hardware and operating system support

Supported hardware:
* Any CPU for which a C++17 OpenMP compiler exists
* NVIDIA CUDA GPUs. Note that clang, which AdaptiveCpp relies on, may not always support the very latest CUDA version which may sometimes impact support for *very* new hardware. See the [clang documentation](https://www.llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html) for more details.
* AMD GPUs that are [supported by ROCm](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#hardware-support)

Operating system support currently strongly focuses on Linux. On Mac, only the CPU backend is expected to work. Windows support with CPU and CUDA backends is experimental, see [Using AdaptiveCpp on Windows](https://github.com/OpenSYCL/OpenSYCL/wiki/Using-Open-SYCL-on-Windows).

## Installing and using AdaptiveCpp
* [Building & Installing](doc/installing.md)

In order to compile software with AdaptiveCpp, use `acpp`. `acpp` can be used like a regular compiler, i.e. you can use `acpp -o test test.cpp` to compile your application called `test.cpp` with AdaptiveCpp.

`syclcc` accepts both command line arguments and environment variables to configure its behavior (e.g., to select the target to compile for). See `syclcc --help` for a comprehensive list of options.

When compiling with AdaptiveCpp, you will need to specify the targets you wish to compile for using the `--acpp-targets="backend1:target1,target2,...;backend2:..."` command line argument, `HIPSYCL_TARGETS` environment variable or cmake argument. See the documentation on [using AdaptiveCpp](doc/using-hipsycl.md) for details.

Instructions for using AdaptiveCpp in CMake projects can also be found in the documentation on [using AdaptiveCpp](doc/using-hipsycl.md).
