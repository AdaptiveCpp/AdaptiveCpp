# hipSYCL - a SYCL implementation for CPUs and GPUs

hipSYCL is a modern SYCL implementation targeting CPUs and GPUs, with a focus on leveraging existing toolchains such as CUDA or HIP. hipSYCL currently targets the following devices:
* Any CPU via OpenMP
* NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA
   - using clang's CUDA toolchain
   - as a library for NVIDIA's nvc++ compiler (experimental)
* AMD GPUs via HIP/ROCm
* Intel GPUs via oneAPI Level Zero and SPIR-V (*highly* experimental and WIP!)

hipSYCL supports compiling source files into a single binary that can run on all these backends when building against appropriate clang distributions. More information about the [compilation flow can be found here](doc/compilation.md).

The runtime architecture of hipSYCL consists of the main library `hipSYCL-rt`, as well as independent, modular plugin libraries for the individual backends:
![Runtime architecture](/doc/img/runtime.png)

hipSYCL's compilation and runtime design allows hipSYCL to **effectively aggregate multiple toolchains that are otherwise incompatible, making them accessible with a single SYCL interface.**

The philosophy behind hipSYCL is to leverage such existing toolchains as much as possible. This brings not only maintenance and stability advantages, but enables performance on par with those established toolchains by design, and also allows for maximum interoperability with existing compute platforms.
For example, the hipSYCL CUDA and ROCm backends rely on the clang CUDA/HIP frontends that have been augmented by hipSYCL to *additionally* also understand SYCL code. This means that the hipSYCL compiler can not only compile SYCL code, but also CUDA/HIP code *even if they are mixed in the same source file*, making all CUDA/HIP features - such as the latest device intrinsics - also available from SYCL code ([details](doc/hip-source-interop.md)). Additionally, vendor-optimized template libraries such as rocPRIM or CUB can also be used with hipSYCL. Consequently, hipSYCL allows for **highly optimized code paths in SYCL code for specific devices**.

Because a SYCL program compiled with hipSYCL looks just like any other CUDA or HIP program to vendor-provided software, vendor tools such as profilers or debuggers also work well with hipSYCL.

## About the project

While hipSYCL started its life as a hobby project, development is now led and funded by Heidelberg University. hipSYCL not only serves as a research platform, but is also a solution used in production on machines of all scales, including some of the most powerful supercomputers.

## Performance

hipSYCL has been repeatedly shown to deliver very competitive performance compared to other SYCL implementations or proprietary solutions like CUDA. See for example:

### Benchmarking hipSYCL

When targeting the CUDA or HIP backends, hipSYCL just massages the AST slightly to get `clang -x cuda` and `clang -x hip` to accept SYCL code. hipSYCL is not involved in the actual code generation. Therefore *any significant deviation in kernel performance compared to clang-compiled CUDA or clang-compiled HIP is unexpected.*

As a consequence, if you compare it to other llvm-based compilers please make sure to compile hipSYCL against the same llvm version. Otherwise you would effectively be simply comparing the performance of two different LLVM versions. This is in particular true when comparing it to clang CUDA or clang HIP.


## Current state
hipSYCL is not yet a fully conformant SYCL implementation, although many SYCL programs already work with hipSYCL.
* SYCL 2020 [feature support matrix](https://github.com/hipSYCL/featuresupport)
* A (likely incomplete) list of [limitations](doc/limitations.md) for older SYCL 1.2.1 features
* A (also incomplete) timeline showing development [history](doc/history.md)

## Hardware and operating system support

Supported hardware:
* Any CPU for which a C++17 OpenMP compiler exists
* NVIDIA CUDA GPUs. Note that clang, which hipSYCL relies on, may not always support the very latest CUDA version which may sometimes impact support for *very* new hardware. See the [clang documentation](https://www.llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html) for more details.
* AMD GPUs that are [supported by ROCm](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm#hardware-support)

Operating system support currently strongly focuses on Linux. On Mac, only the CPU backend is expected to work. Windows support with CPU and CUDA backends is experimental, see [Using hipSYCL on Windows](https://github.com/illuhad/hipSYCL/wiki/Using-hipSYCL-on-Windows).

## Installing and using hipSYCL
* [Building & Installing](doc/installing.md)

In order to compile software with hipSYCL, use `syclcc` which automatically adds all required compiler arguments to the CUDA/HIP compiler. `syclcc` can be used like a regular compiler, i.e. you can use `syclcc -o test test.cpp` to compile your SYCL application called `test.cpp` with hipSYCL.

`syclcc` accepts both command line arguments and environment variables to configure its behavior (e.g., to select the target platform CUDA/ROCm/CPU to compile for). See `syclcc --help` for a comprehensive list of options.

When compiling with hipSYCL, you will need to specify the targets you wish to compile for using the `--hipsycl-targets="backend1:target1,target2,...;backend2:..."` command line argument, `HIPSYCL_TARGETS` environment variable or cmake argument. See the documentation on [using hipSYCL](doc/using-hipsycl.md) for details.

Instructions for using hipSYCL in CMake projects can also be found in the documentation on [using hipSYCL](doc/using-hipsycl.md).
