# Environment variables used by hipSYCL

* `HIPSYCL_DEBUG_LEVEL`: if set, overrides the output verbosity. `0`: none, `1`: error, `2`: warning, `3`: info, `4`: verbose, default is the value of `HIPSYCL_DEBUG_LEVEL` [macro](macros.md).
* `HIPSYCL_VISIBILITY_MASK`: can be used to activate only a subset of backends. Syntax: `backend;backend2;..`. Possible values are `omp`, `cuda`, `hip` and `ze` (as level zero is the backend and `spirv` in `HIPSYCL_TARGETS` just the target format). `omp` will always be active as a CPU backend is required. Device level visibility has to be set via vendor specific variables for now, including `{CUDA,HIP}_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and `ZE_AFFINITY_MASK`.
* `HIPSYCL_RT_DAG_REQ_OPTIMIZATION_DEPTH`: maximum depth when descending the DAG requirement tree to look for DAG optimization opportunities, such as eliding unnecessary dependencies.
* `HIPSYCL_RT_MQE_LANE_STATISTICS_MAX_SIZE`: For the `multi_queue_executor`, the maximum size of entries in the lane statistics, i.e. the maximum number of submissions to retain statistical information about. This information is used to estimate execution lane utilization.
* `HIPSYCL_RT_MQE_LANE_STATISTICS_DELAY_TIME`: The time in seconds (floating point value) after which to forget information about old submissions.
